Description of Kaggle Comp :
"Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time.
Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). 
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster."
